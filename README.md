**Isle** is an easy-to-use, flexible React static site generator. It provides production ready defaults, while mantaining a great developer experience.

Setting up a statically-served React app can seem daunting at first. Other projects such as [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) help you build apps faster by providing a zero-config setup.

Isle brings the best of two worlds by focusing on static site exports (instead of Server Side rendering), and allowing you to customize your app the same way you would on a standalone project.
